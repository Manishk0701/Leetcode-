Approach
Initialize variables buy with the first element of the prices array and profit as 0.
Iterate through the prices starting from the second element.
Update the buy variable if the current price is lower than the current buying price.
Update the profit if the difference between the current price and the buying price is greater than the current profit.
Return the final profit.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<prices.size(); i++){
            if(prices[i]<buy){
                buy=prices[i];
            }else if(prices[i]-buy>profit){
                profit=prices[i]-buy;
            }
        }
        return profit;
        
    }
};
